# Unit Tests

These samples demonstrate how to perform unit testing on a service's action.

When *UnitTesting* an actions logic, you need to reference your service's assembly, setup an ephemeral service container, mock all the dependencies and invoke the action.
For a sample of this procedure you can have a look at the Foompany.Services.SampleService1.Tests/SampleModule1.cs test cases.
